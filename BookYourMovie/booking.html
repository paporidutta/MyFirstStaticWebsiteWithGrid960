        <p>Bollywood is the sobriquet for India's Hindi language film industry, based in the city of Mumbai (formerly Bombay), Maharashtra.
         It is more formally referred to as Hindi cinema.
          The term "Bollywood" is often used by non-Indians as a synecdoche to refer to the whole of Indian cinema.
           However, Bollywood proper is only a part of the larger Indian film industry, which includes other production centres producing films in many other Indian languages.</p>
